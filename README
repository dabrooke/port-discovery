# Usage

## Step 1 - Create your inventory.yaml file

This file will be the basis for which PyATS will parse/gather outputs from so that the python script can generate the needed output CSV files.  This example shows two devices (switch1 and switch2) but it can collect as many (or little) as needed.

```
devices:
  switch1:
    connections:
      cli:
        ip: 10.10.10.10
        protocol: ssh
    os: iosxe
    type: iosxe
  switch2:
    connections:
      cli:
        ip: 10.20.20.83
        protocol: ssh
    os: iosxe
    type: iosxe
testbed:
  credentials:
    default:
      password: '%ASK{}'
      username: '%ASK{}'
```


## Step 2 - Populate your mapping.yaml file

Fill out the mapping.yaml file with site-specific relavant inputs needed to associate legacy VLANs to new SDA IP Pool names to use for assignments.

```
sites:
  site1:
     devices:
      hostname: DCSwitch
         user_vlan:
          legacy: 10
          poolname: User-Pool
         voice_vlan:
          legacy: 20
          poolname: Voice-Pool
         video_vlan:
          legacy: 30
          poolname: Video-Pool
         printer_vlan:
          legacy: 40
          poolname: Printer-Pool
	  
```

## Step 3 - Run the script

```
python3 discovery.py site1
